Thin-Layer Placement

Thin-layer placement (TLP), for the purpose of this project, may be operationally defined as
1) “purposeful” placement of dredged material with the objective of environmental restoration
or benefit without restriction to location (for example, upland, aquatic, marsh, or brownfields)
and 2) dredged material placement at depths of “mm to cm” (or “inches to feet”) as compared to
placements typical of disposal, which may be several meters in depth.

CE-Dredge


CE-Dredge, a collaborative effort between the US Army Engineer Research and Development
Center (ERDC) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Mobile District (CESAM), provides
custom maps, tools, and applications designed to assist users in managing USACE dredging
operations.


Regional Sediment Management


The Regional Sediment Management (RSM) program develops the tools and knowledge necessary
to assist in the development and implementation of regional strategies and an understanding
of the effects of sediment management actions on all landscapes—from the upper watershed
to the coastline—on both local and regional scales. Major products resulting from RSM include
a sediment budget tool that can be used to assess the impacts of activities on adjacent projects
and the overall region, morphology modeling systems for coast and river systems that predict
long-term, large-scale morphology changes, and a framework for developing RSM strategies and
implementing RSM solutions in the field.


Project Overview

During Phase 1 of this project, the US Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, Operations
Division, Spatial Data Branch, Geographic Information Systems Section(CESAM-OP-J-GIS)
developed a way for the US Army Corps of Engineers, Engineer Research and Development Center,
Environmental Laboratory, Environmental Processes and Engineering Division, Environmental
Engineering Branch (CEERD-EP-E) to collect thin-layer placement project site data and visualize it
on the CE-Dredge /RSM map. 

This map is available at https://sam-ap-map4mob.sam.ds.usace.army.mil/portal/home/item.html?id=1085411e5c7941b985d118a0d10814fd.


During Phase 2, CEERD-EP-E requested that CESAM-OP-J-GIS enhance the web map by making it
more user friendly and by providing additional functionality, including collecting case study data
and making the map accessible to non-USACE users without a CAC as well as to USACE users.
Now, CEERD-EP-E has requested that CESAM-OP-J-GIS enhance the web map and case study data
collection web application.
